# XGBoost

XGBoostExt is developed on the basis of [xgboost4j-spark](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jvm/scaladocs/xgboost4j-spark/index.html), and relevant parameters can be referred to the corresponding official documents.

> Currently only support spark 2.3.x

XGBoost is exactly the same as other built-in algorithms.

{"features":[5.1,3.5,1.4,0.2],"label":1.0}

''';



load jsonStr.`jsonStr` as data;
select vec_dense(features) as features ,label as label from data
as data1;

train data1 as XGBoostExt.`/tmp/model`;

```
the result as followsï¼š

```

name            value
---------------	------------------
modelPath	/tmp/model/_model_24/model/0
algIndex	0
alg	ml.dmlc.xgboost4j.scala.spark.WowXGBoostClassifier

```



## batch prediction

```sql
-- batch predict
predict data1 as XGBoostExt.`/tmp/model`;
```

## API prediction

```sql
-- api predict
register XGBoostExt.`/tmp/model` as npredict;
select npredict(features) from data as output;
```
