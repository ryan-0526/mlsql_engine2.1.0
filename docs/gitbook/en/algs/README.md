# MLSQL built-in algorithms

The integration of Python is introduced in the previous chapters. In cluster mode, some special configurations need to be made, and CONDA needs to be installed on each node. But the algorithms in this chapter are built-in.
It works without special dependencies. This chapter focuses on the following four algorithms, the others are almost the same.
1. RandomForest
2. XGBoost
3. ALS
4. LDA
